 }
}
A. Error
B. True True
C. True False
D. True 1
Answer: D) True 1
Explanation:
The Equals() method returns a bool value. We assigned s1 to s3. Thus, the 
statement s1.Equals(s3) will returns "True". And, the CompareTo() method 
returns an int value (Less than 0, o, or greater than 0). The 
statement s2.CompareTo(s1) will returns 1 because this instance (s2) follows s1.

 }
}
A. 0
B. 1
C. -1
D. Error
Answer: C) -1
Explanation:
The IndexOf() method returns the index of a given characters, and it returns -1 if 
the given character is not found in the string. Here, we are trying to get the index of 
'h' which is not present in the string. Thus, the output will be -1.
