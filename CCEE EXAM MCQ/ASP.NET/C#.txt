C#
1)It is an OOP language produced by Microsoft that run on .NET framework
2)The first version was released in 2002 and latest version is C#-12 released in 2023
3)Used for: Mobile applications, Desktop applications, Web applications, Web services, Web sites, Games, VR, Database applications
4)In C# an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is used to edit and compile code.
5)i)C# ignores white space
  ii)using System means that we can use classes from the System namespace.
  iii)curly braces {} marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.
  iv)// used for single line comment
  v)/* */ used for multi-line comment
6)data types in C#: int(4), long(8), float(4), double(8), char(2), string(2 bytes per character), bool(1), const
  declaration of datatypes: int myNum = 100000; long myNum = 15000000000L; float myNum = 5.75F; double myNum = 19.99D; bool isCSharpFun = true; char myGrade = 'B'; string greeting = "Hello World";
7)C# is case sensitive.
8)Type casting: A)Implicit Casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size(char -> int -> long -> float -> double)
                B)Explicit Casting (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type (double -> float -> long -> int -> char)
  *It is also possible to convert data types explicitly by using built-in methods, such as [Convert.ToBoolean, Convert.ToDouble, Convert.ToString, Convert.ToInt32 (int) and Convert.ToInt64 (long)]
9)User Input: (1)Console.WriteLine() is used to output (print) values (2)Console.ReadLine() to get user input.
10)Operators: 
    A)Arithmetic 
        +	Addition, -	Subtraction, *	Multiplication, /	Division, %	Modulus	(Remainder after division), ++	Increment	(+1), --	Decrement	(+1)	
    B)Assignment
       =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, |=, ^=, >>=, <<=
    C)Comparison
        ==	Equal to, !=	Not equal, >	Greater than, <	Less than, >=	Greater than or equal to, <=	Less than or equal to
    D)Logical
        && 	Logical and	Returns True if both statements are true	x < 5 &&  x < 10	
        || 	Logical or	Returns True if one of the statements is true	x < 5 || x < 4	
        !	Logical not
11)C# Math function
  A) Math.Max(x,y) :  method can be used to find the highest value of x and y
  B) Math.Min(x,y) :  method can be used to find the smallest value of x and y
  C) Math.Sqrt(x) : method returns the square root of x
  D) Math.Abs(x) : method returns the absolute (positive) value of x
  E) Math.Round() : rounds a number to the nearest whole number
12) C# String
  A) Length: .Length is used
  B) uppercase: .ToUpper() is used
  C) lowercase: .ToLower() is used
  D) concat: + is used (Note: number is added & string is concat)
  E) interpolation: $ is used
  F) Access string: You can access the characters in a string by referring to its index number inside square brackets []
      1. [1] is showing the character at 1st place
      2. IndexOf("e") is showing the index of that character
  G) special character
      1. \'		Single quote
      2. \"		Double quote
      3. \\		Backslash
      4. \n	 New Line	
      5.  \t	Tab	
      6. \b	 Backspace
13) Boolean: (1)Yes/No  (2)On/Off  (3)True/False
14) Polymorphism means "many forms".
15) Inheritance lets us inherit fields and methods from another class.
16) Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks.
17) think of a base class called Animal that has a method called animalSound().


DOTNET
1).NET is a developer platform made up of tools, programming languages, and libraries for building many different types of applications.
2).NET Framework is the execution and development environment for .NET applications.
3) It supports running websites, services, desktop apps, and more on Windows.
4)The heart of the .NET Framework is the CLR
5)It is a runtime environment that executes MSIL
6)CLR is present in every .NET framework version
7).NET applications are deployed as assemblies, which can be a single executable or a collection of components and form a logical unit of functionality
8)Types: 1.Private 2.Shared 3.Satellite
